# Joonas von Lerber
Hey, there!👋

I am a programming and math hobbyist studying at Otaniemi Upper secondary school in Finland.

I do projects on my free time and mostly do stuff realting to or anything that involves math. 

### Currently working on
- Cryptography crate 🔗[Secretcrab](https://github.com/Joonas-vonlerber/Secretcrab) 🔐🔓
- An article in finnish about implementing neural networks in the Rust programming language 🔗[impl-nn](https://github.com/Joonas-vonlerber/impl-nn)🦀📰

### Previous projects
- Machine learning crate for creating and teaching neural networks 🔗[Rusticneurons](https://github.com/Joonas-vonlerber/rusticneurons)🦀🧠
- An article in finnish about artifical neural networks and the math behind them. Answers questions such as: How do neural networks learn? What applications are they used for? Why can they be used for so many applications? 🔗[article](https://matematiikkalehtisolmu.fi/2023/3/neuroverkot.pdf) 📰🧠
- Newton-Raphson root finding algorithm implemented in julia and python 🔗[newt_approx](https://github.com/Joonas-vonlerber/Newton_approximation)🟥
